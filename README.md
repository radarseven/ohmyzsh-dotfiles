# Michael's Dotfiles: *Adapted from Mathias and Paul Irish for ZSH by Matt Stauffer.*

## Installation

### Using Git and the bootstrap script

You can clone the repository wherever you want. (I like to keep it in `~/Projects/dotfiles`, with `~/dotfiles` as a symlink.) The bootstrapper script will pull in the latest version and copy the files to your home folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/radarseven/ohmyzsh-dotfiles.git
```

#### Bootstrap

~~The bootstrap.sh file currently doesn't work, so just copy any of the dotfiles you like into your home directory.~~

**Bootstrap now works!** Run `bash bootstrap.sh` to copy files into the `~` directory.

This should be run anytime changes are made in this repo.

### Git-free install

To install these dotfiles without Git:

```bash
cd; curl -#L https://github.com/radarseven/ohmyzsh-dotfiles/tarball/master | tar -xzv --strip-components 1 --exclude={README.md,bootstrap.sh}
```

To update later on, just run that command again.

### Specify the `$PATH`

If `~/.mix-path` exists, it will be sourced along with the other files, before any feature testing (such as [detecting which version of `ls` is being used](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/aff769fd75225d8f2e481185a71d5e05b76002dc/.aliases#L21-26)) takes place.

Here’s an example `~/.mix-path` file that adds `~/utils` to the `$PATH`:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/utils:$PATH"
```

### Add custom commands without creating a new fork

If `~/.mix-extra` exists, it will be sourced along with the other files. You can use this to add a few custom commands without the need to fork this entire repository, or to add commands you don’t want to commit to a public repository.

### **UPDATED**: Install Homebrew formulae

#### `brew bundle` no longer supported

See `/setup/osx-setup-part1-.md` for a new approach on how to install apps using Homebrew.

~~When setting up a new Mac, you may want to install some common [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) formulae (after installing Homebrew, of course):~~
